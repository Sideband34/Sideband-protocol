# AI Coding Agent Instructions — sideband-protocol

## Mission
Implement **only the `sideband-protocol` subsystem** as defined in `docs/PROJECT_MASTER.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/SRD.md`, and `docs/TECHNICAL_BUILD.md`. The entire product is Sideband: A local service microcommerce protocol. Compatible nearby devices negotiate a metered service over Bluetooth/local Wi-Fi and exchange signed cumulative payment commitments. A payer has previously funded a Stellar channel while online; offline service usage is later settled on-chain when connectivity returns. The voucher itself is not instant final money transfer.

## Neighbor repositories
`sideband-mobile`, `sideband-gateway`, `sideband-channels`. You are responsible for your own component and versioned integrations; do not duplicate their owners' logic.

## Do not assume this is already built
This is an initial build-handoff scaffold with documents, brand drafts, environment guidance and directories. There is no existing working product, deployment, live integration, approved Drips application, mobile store listing or audited production contract.

## Execution
1. Read all project docs and verify the **domain safety constraints** first.
2. Define your contracts with sibling repos using schema/ABI and fixtures. Agree on versioned handshake.
3. Complete M0 and M1 before style polish or unrelated new features.
4. Make small, testable PRs and record architecture changes in ADRs.
5. Never pretend missing product or chain integrations are working; use clearly labeled test adapters.
6. Write real tests for system logic and failure paths, not only mocked happy paths.
7. Don't ask for production funds/credentials; use Testnet and synthetic providers.
8. Keep UI architecture flexible and let design be refined while respecting the brand's flat-icon and functional requirements.
